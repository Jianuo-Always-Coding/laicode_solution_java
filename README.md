# [Binary Search](https://github.com/Jianuo-Always-Coding/laicode_solution_java/tree/main/BinarySearch/)

This part contains the problems which can use binary search to solve to optimize time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).

Binary search always solve problems with 2 conditions such sorted array and find a arget number.

# [Linked List](https://github.com/Jianuo-Always-Coding/laicode_solution_java/tree/main/LinkedList/)

This part contains the problems which is related to a new class List Node. This part can do **mergeSortLinkedList** and **CheckIfLinkedListIsPalindrome** to review.
```java
class ListNode {
    public int value;
    public ListNode next;
    public ListNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        next = null;
    }
}

```
The key point of this part including

- find mid node
- reverse a Linked List
- combine two Linked List

# [Recursion](https://github.com/Jianuo-Always-Coding/laicode_solution_java/tree/main/Recursion/)

This part contains some problems which can be solved with recursion, including some sort algorithms, such as **Selection Sort, Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort**. Notably, tail recursion can be converted into iteration.
