# [Binary Search](https://github.com/Jianuo-Always-Coding/laicode_solution_java/tree/main/BinarySearch/)
This part contains which can use binary search to solve, which can optimize time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).

Binary search always solve problems with 2 conditions such sorted array and find a arget number.
