# [Binary Search](https://github.com/Jianuo-Always-Coding/laicode_solution_java/tree/main/BinarySearch/)
This part contains the problems which can use binary search to solve to optimize time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).

Binary search always solve problems with 2 conditions such sorted array and find a arget number.

# [Linked List](https://github.com/Jianuo-Always-Coding/laicode_solution_java/tree/main/LinkedList/)

This part contains the problems which is related to a new class List Node. This part can do **mergeSortLinkedList** and **CheckIfLinkedListIsPalindrome** to review.

    class ListNode {
        public int value;
        public ListNode next;
        public ListNode(int value) {
            this.value = value;
            next = null;
        }
    }

The key point of this part including
- find mid node
- reverse a Linked List
- combine two Linked List
